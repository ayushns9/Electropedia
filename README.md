We all know how tough it gets while comparing the prices of the electronics we are to buy on different e-commerce sites. It gets confusing and takes a lot of time and energy. Inspired by this problem our project focuses on implementing a system that gives the cheapest price available for that particular product to a user taking the information from various e-commerce sites and presenting it after due comparisons.
