Visit our website at to find the cheapest price for the electronics you want!: [http://dbms-website.herokuapp.com/](http://dbms-website.herokuapp.com/)

Inspired by this problem our project focuses on implementing a system that gives the cheapest price available for that particular product to a user taking the information from various e-commerce sites and presenting it after due comparisons.
